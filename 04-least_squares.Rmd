# Least Squares
In least-squares problems, the objective have the following special form:
\begin{align}
  f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j = 1}^m r^2_j(x).
\end{align}
We call $r_j$ a residual.
Furthermore we now that it is a smooth function from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}$.
The special form of $f$ makes this particular type of problem easier to solve than general unconstrained minimization problems.

## Linear least-squares problems
If the model $\phi(x;t_j)$ is a linear function of $x$ what we have is a linear least-squares problem.
The residual is given by $r(x) = Jx - y$, where we call $J$ the design matrix.
The objective function becomes
\begin{align}
  f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\|Jx - y\|^2.
\end{align}


<!-- We will start by assembling the individual components $r_j$ into a residual vector $r : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, as follows -->
<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!--   r(x) = \left( r_1(x),r_2(x),\ldots,r_m(x) \right)^\top. -->
<!-- \end{align} -->
